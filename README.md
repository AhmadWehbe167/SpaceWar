# SpaceWar Game
That was my first project in my first semester in University 
(the course is introduction to programming)

I have gained some experience working with object-oriented 
programming because the game heavily depends on it.

However, the main problem with this code is that it is Monolithic.
A better way would be to apply seperation of concerns
and simple responsibility principles to make the code ready to change,
easier to read, and safe from bugs.
